# Media Library

Update: October, 2021

Media Library was created almost 3 years ago at this point. The technology and the thought process discussed throughout the posts are still relevant. There a few key things that I would do differently if I were starting the project today.

1. Typescript - I only work in Typescript today, no more Javascript.
2. API - I worked with backend libraries in the client code throughout the project. Today, I'm strict about separating client and server with an API.
3. Redux - More than ever, I still use and believe Redux is the right solution for global state management in a React application. However, I would use all of the dramatic improvements encompassed in the React Toolkit and RTK Query.

With that said the original posts and technology are preserved here for posterity.
