# Profile

## Peter Dyer

Peter is a freelance developer who builds fullstack applications leveraging React front-ends, web and native, with serverless, cloud native, back-ends. He primarily uses AWS today but has used Google Firebase (with a little Google Cloud) in the past. His programming language of choice is TypeScript. He believes in decoupled applications that leverage Rest or GraphQL APIs. He is active in the tech community via Meetups and conferences. You can often find me at the GraphQL, AWS and Javascript Meetups in Toronto.
