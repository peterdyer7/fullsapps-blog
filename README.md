# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Deployment

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
